# 👋 Hi, I’m **Frederick Baffour**
### **AI Security Assurance Engineer | LLM Red Teaming | Model Supply-Chain Security | AI Risk & Governance**

Welcome to my GitHub.  
I specialize in **AI Security Assurance**, focusing on the end-to-end security, safety, and governance of AI systems — from model intake and supply-chain verification to adversarial red-teaming, risk classification, and runtime monitoring.

My work bridges **deep technical engineering** and **governance-aligned AI risk management**, following NIST AI RMF, MITRE ATLAS, and ISO 42001 practices.

# 🔐 What I Do

### **AI Security Assurance Engineering**
- LLM red teaming (Garak, Promptfoo, manual stress testing)  
- Jailbreak, prompt injection, and refusal bypass evaluation  
- Safety + toxicity checks, hallucination analysis  
- Secure model execution environments  
- AI system misuse and abuse surface analysis  

### **Model Supply-Chain & Integrity**
- SHA-256 model hashing  
- YARA static rules for malicious content  
- ClamAV malware scanning  
- Sigcheck binary verification  
- Model provenance + metadata validation  
- SBOM generation & dependency risk assessment  

### **AI Risk, Governance & Compliance**
- Model risk classification frameworks  
- Criticality tiering (Low → Critical)  
- NIST AI RMF mapping: Govern / Map / Measure / Manage  
- ISO/IEC 42001 alignment  
- MITRE ATLAS TTP mapping  
- Governance-ready documentation & evaluation summaries
