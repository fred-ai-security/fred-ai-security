👋 Hi, I’m Frederick Baffour  
AI Security Assurance Engineer | LLM Red Teaming | Model Supply-Chain Security

I specialize in AI Security Assurance, focusing on how AI models are evaluated, tested, and documented before use in real environments. My work covers the full lifecycle—from model intake and supply-chain verification to adversarial testing and structured reporting.

My background is in enterprise security engineering, and I apply the same discipline to AI systems: clear methodology, reproducible testing, and evidence-based conclusions.

- LLM red teaming (Garak, Promptfoo, manual testing)  
- Jailbreak, prompt-injection, and refusal-bypass evaluation  
- Model supply-chain integrity (hashing, SBOMs, static analysis)  
- Secure model execution and misuse analysis  

## 🧰 Core Tools
- Garak, Promptfoo  
- YARA, ClamAV, Sigcheck  
- Syft / Grype  
- Ollama, HuggingFace CLI
